# Estimation-of-Quadrotor-State

**Problem Statement**

In this phase, a vision-based 3-D velocity estimator is implemented and compared against a provided dataset gathered using some certain reliable and robust method.

**Running the Code**

To run the code, just run Wrapper.m script.

Machine Vision Toolbox for MATLAB of Peter Corke has been used to compute the homography. Computer Vision Toolbox of MATLAB has also been used for Velocity Estimation.
